# Problem Statement

Traditional centralized financial systems often suffer from issues such as lack of transparency, limited accessibility, and susceptibility to manipulation or censorship. Additionally, many existing decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms are confined to a single blockchain network, limiting their potential reach and interoperability.

To address these challenges, the Edgeverse DAO aims to create a decentralized investment platform that operates across multiple chains while utilizing token-based governance mechanisms. By doing so, it seeks to empower users with transparent and accessible investment opportunities while fostering greater decentralization in the financial landscape.
