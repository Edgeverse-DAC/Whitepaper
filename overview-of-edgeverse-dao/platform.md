A comprehensive exploration of the Aragon OSx protocol reveals its underlying structural components and their respective roles. The governance layer is formed by the framework DAO, which serves as the backbone of decision-making processes. Concurrently, the code layer encompasses the framework and core contracts, relying on external libraries and services to facilitate seamless integration and functionality within the protocol's framework.
