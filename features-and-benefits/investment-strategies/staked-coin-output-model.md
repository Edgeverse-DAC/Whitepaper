# Staked Coin Output Model

Another unique investment method we utilize is staked coin output (SCO).  This approach resembles a polkadot crowdloan, but with some added features. SCO introduces a novel staking rewards model that offers unparalleled flexibility to projects and token holders, attracting significant attention from institutions. In this model, projects allocate their token supply to the staking pool, where Edgeverse DAO, Edgeware DAO, and users stake their EDG tokens in return for project tokens. The project team determines a fixed annual percentage yield (APY) for these rewards, which vary based on the staking time period: 30 days, 180 days, or 1 year. The longer the staking period, the higher the rewards. It's important to note that unstaking requests will take approximately 14 days to process. Furthermore, we have plans to develop staking contracts for other substrate tokens like Polkadot, Kusama, and Kabocha.

By leveraging these decentralized investment methods at Edgeverse DAO, we aim to ensure the safety of our users' investments while supporting innovative projects that contribute value to the ecosystem.
