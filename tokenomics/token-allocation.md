The distribution of EDGV tokens will take place through public sales, ensuring broad participation and fair access for interested individuals and entities. The specific breakdown of the token distribution is as follows:

**Private Sale:** During the private sale, a portion of the token supply will be reserved for strategic partners, early investors, and institutional investors. These tokens will be offered at a reduced price before the commencement of the public sale.

**Public Sale:** A portion of the tokens will be made available for public sale to retail investors and community members who wish to participate in Edgeverse DAO's ecosystem. The public sale may involve various mechanisms, such as an Initial DEX Offering (IDO), Initial Exchange Offering (IEO), or other formats that comply with regulatory requirements.

**Team and Advisors:** A reasonable share of the total token supply will be allocated to reward the core team members, developers, advisors, and contributors who actively contribute to the success of Edgeverse DAO. This allocation ensures alignment among stakeholders while incentivizing long-term commitment towards achieving project goals.

**Public treasury:** A portion of the total token supply will be allocated to the public treasury. These tokens will serve as reserves for future development, partnerships, and ecosystem growth. The public treasury will be managed transparently through token-based governance by the community members holding EDGV tokens.

**Liquidity Provision:** A portion of the tokens will be allocated to liquidity provision across decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and automated market makers (AMMs). This allocation aims to ensure healthy trading activity, price stability, and accessibility for EDGV token holders.
