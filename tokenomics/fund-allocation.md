**EDG Token Repurchase Program:** A portion of the generated funds will be allocated towards the repurchase and strategic reinvestment of EDG tokens in Edgeware ecosystem initiatives. Our token holders will be rewarded through staking EDG, offering a current annual yield of 25%. Additionally, staking EDGV tokens provides an opportunity to earn EDG.

**Liquidity & Listing :** A segment of the funds raised will be dedicated to enhancing liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEX) and securing listings on centralized exchanges.

**Platform Development :** A portion of the funds raised will be designated for the initial development of the platform. Any remaining funds will be returned to the treasury. Future additions of new features will be proposed and considered through the proposal system.

**Public Treasury :** All remaining funds will be moved to the on-chain treasury, which will be used to invest in new projects.
